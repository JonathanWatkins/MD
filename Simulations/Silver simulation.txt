# An example simulation of silver
# -------------------------------

Element: Silver

dt                 : 1.0   # [fs]
Initial Temperature: 580.0 # [K] MSD linear at approx. 12500 K, why not earlier??
Desired temperature: 522   # [K] (: 0.9 * Initial temperature) #TODO: Why times 0.9?
Desired pressure   : 1 atm # The atmospheric pressure

# Init simulation specific constants
Number of particles     : 100   # The number of particles
Sampling period         : 5     # Number of timesteps between sampling of properties
Number of timesteps     : 10000 # Desired (or minimum) total number of timesteps
Inner cutoff            : 2.5   # [Sigma] TODO: Make sure this is 2.5 times sigma
Outer cutoff            : 1.1   # [Inner cutoff] Fewer neighbors -> faster, but too thin skin is not good either. TODO: Change skin thickness to a good one
Impulseresponse exponent: 0.0   # The exponent in the impulse response function used to filter the measured values

# Control

Thermostat time: 3.0  # [fs]
dEp tolerance  : 0.01 # TODO: Depricate this variable soon?
Constants      : NVE  #
# NPE, NVE, NVT or NPT
# N: Number of particles/atoms
